/**
 * flat_map works applying a function (callback) that returns a sequence for each element in a collection,
 * and flattening the results into the resulting array.
 *
 * flat_map(...) differs from flatten(map(...)) because it only flattens one level of nesting,
 * whereas flatten will recursively flatten nested collections.
 *
 * For example if map(collection, callback) returns [[],1,[2,3],[[4]]]
 * then flat_map(collection, callback) will return [1,2,3,[4]]
 * while flatten(map(collection, callback)) will return [1,2,3,4]
 *
 * @param Traversable|array $collection
 * @param callable $callback
 * @return array
